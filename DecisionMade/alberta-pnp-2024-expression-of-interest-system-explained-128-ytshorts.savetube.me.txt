You
0:00:00 – 0:00:02

You
0:00:02 – 0:00:04

All right, everybody welcome to this later evening
0:00:30 – 0:00:34

Livestream I'm here with my
0:00:34 – 0:00:37

fearless colleague Igor Kruljic who did not have time to get back to his house before we went live to talk about
0:00:37 – 0:00:46

What is probably one of the most?
0:00:46 – 0:00:49

Significant changes and developments for the Alberta
0:00:49 – 0:00:54

PNP which became the Alberta immigrant nominee program
0:00:54 – 0:00:58

Which now we you know fondly recognizes the Alberta advantage immigration program
0:00:59 – 0:01:04

And I'll be honest for many years you guys I truly did believe that Alberta had an advantage
0:01:04 – 0:01:10

Why because it wasn't complicated to qualify through the Alberta opportunity stream
0:01:10 – 0:01:16

but all of that has now changed and no longer is it a simple process of do I meet the eligibility for the
0:01:16 – 0:01:25

Alberta opportunity stream or the real renewal stream or the
0:01:26 – 0:01:30

Accelerated tech pathway and the list goes on now. It's
0:01:30 – 0:01:34

essentially
0:01:34 – 0:01:36

submit an expression of interest just like British Columbia like Saskatchewan's program like Ontario and
0:01:36 – 0:01:43

Do this keep your fingers crossed
0:01:43 – 0:01:46

All right, Igor. Welcome. Where are you at given the fact you weren't able to make it back to your house?
0:01:46 – 0:01:52

Yeah, long story short. There was a Canadian immigration lawyers association meeting today in downtown, Calgary
0:01:53 – 0:02:00

and I've attended the
0:02:00 – 0:02:02

Meeting so got to meet a lot of our colleagues got to have some wonderful chats about interesting topics
0:02:02 – 0:02:09

including the topics of
0:02:09 – 0:02:11

business and economic development in Alberta and how immigration impacts economic
0:02:11 – 0:02:16

landscape in our province, so it was a
0:02:16 – 0:02:19

Wonderful meeting. So thank you a lot for Sheila if someone is watching us from Sheila
0:02:20 – 0:02:25

So I couldn't make it home
0:02:25 – 0:02:28

After the end of the meeting, so I'm stuck here in downtown, Calgary
0:02:28 – 0:02:32

So I will probably share the views a little bit with our fellow
0:02:32 – 0:02:37

viewers, so this is the
0:02:37 – 0:02:40

This is the promenade right next to the Bow River. So that's where a lot of people
0:02:40 – 0:02:46

go to spend their free time in the evening after work and
0:02:47 – 0:02:50

essentially, that's the place that many people see on the pictures dreaming about coming to Alberta and
0:02:50 – 0:02:57

When they get here, they really enjoy spending their time. Just walking breathing the fresh air
0:02:57 – 0:03:04

observing the Bow River and
0:03:04 – 0:03:06

Yeah, like that's a wonderful place to actually host this live stream today with you mark because I
0:03:06 – 0:03:14

Just look at all of those people who walk on the streets and I understand that I was one of them four years ago
0:03:14 – 0:03:20

But I was lucky to immigrate through the federal immigration program now many of those people who cross and pass me
0:03:20 – 0:03:27

on the streets over here
0:03:27 – 0:03:29

They don't have that privilege of
0:03:29 – 0:03:32

Immigrating to the federal immigration programs and the only option for them was the Alberta opportunity stream
0:03:32 – 0:03:38

Now with the new changes there are chances of staying in Canada, maybe either better or maybe much worse
0:03:38 – 0:03:45

So that's probably what we will be talking about today in detail
0:03:45 – 0:03:49

so
0:03:49 – 0:03:51

Really glad to be connected from this beautiful place in here in downtown, Calgary
0:03:51 – 0:03:55

Excellent. Thank you Igor now. I want to just
0:03:55 – 0:03:59

Mention to other people I was actually going to be at that
0:03:59 – 0:04:04

Sela festivity, but unfortunately for me. Well, not unfortunately I
0:04:04 – 0:04:09

forgot that I have a
0:04:09 – 0:04:12

Job in my church to run the activities for the young, you know eight to eleven year old boys
0:04:12 – 0:04:19

And so tonight we actually planned a treasure hunt and I know this is completely off topic. But hey, I don't care this
0:04:19 – 0:04:26

This is what we're doing. So I'll show you here
0:04:26 – 0:04:30

This is what we created if it if it will appear on the screen, here we go
0:04:30 – 0:04:35

So this is the treasure chest and I didn't show you what was inside which was a bunch of these gold coins that were
0:04:35 – 0:04:41

filled with with chocolate
0:04:41 – 0:04:43

And the yeah, these young little kids boy. They had a heck of a time
0:04:43 – 0:04:48

We used compasses and we followed a pre-designed
0:04:48 – 0:04:52

treasure map complete with you know
0:04:52 – 0:04:56

Scrolls and and all these kinds of things and it was a lot of fun with the young little kids
0:04:56 – 0:05:00

So I didn't make it up to Calgary
0:05:00 – 0:05:02

But in all honesty gave me a little bit more time to soak in
0:05:02 – 0:05:06

everything that has been going on with the program and I know that there's been lots of people who have
0:05:06 – 0:05:11

Had who've chimed in who have had thoughts on what this means for immigration in Alberta
0:05:11 – 0:05:16

Igor and I are hopefully gonna be able to decipher some of this information
0:05:16 – 0:05:19

I was able to attend a meeting today that I can't really talk too much about
0:05:19 – 0:05:24

Regarding this new system that's gonna be rolled out
0:05:26 – 0:05:28

But I did have permission to share a few things that I learned and try to dispel some of the myths associated with it. So
0:05:28 – 0:05:36

Welcome everybody that's tuning in wherever you're tuning in from
0:05:36 – 0:05:39

Please please post in the comments where you are listening from because we would love to see how far this is reaching
0:05:39 – 0:05:47

I'm curious to know how many people outside of the province of Alberta are watching what's happening here
0:05:47 – 0:05:53

And how many are really located here in in Alberta that this will have direct impact to?
0:05:53 – 0:06:00

So go ahead post your questions. We'll definitely jump in. I welcome your thoughts
0:06:00 – 0:06:06

I welcome, you know, everybody's had a chance about a day to look now at the
0:06:06 – 0:06:10

The actual point system and in my discussions with some of the government officials earlier today
0:06:10 – 0:06:17

I brought up some of the comments that you know that you folks have mentioned and I can see here
0:06:17 – 0:06:22

We've got a number of people all chiming in and guess where they're in
0:06:22 – 0:06:25

Igor we've got hopefully not only not on the promenade. Yeah, maybe they're right behind you
0:06:25 – 0:06:32

They're gonna poke their head in and say hello. We do have
0:06:32 – 0:06:35

Petra's is in BC. We've got Zaheer in Edmonton Taj, of course in Grand Prairie and
0:06:35 – 0:06:42

will definitely
0:06:42 – 0:06:45

Giselle says good evening. I'm so far from Igor downtown Calgary. Well Igor is downtown Calgary. He sure is
0:06:45 – 0:06:52

We've got Marcus in Spruce Grove. We do have Alexander's tuning in from Toronto and Himal who's also in in Ontario
0:06:52 – 0:07:00

Turek's in Calgary Sumit's Fort Saskatchewan
0:07:00 – 0:07:04

Shalia's is in Calgary. Ah, we've got Batman. He's tuning in as always
0:07:04 – 0:07:10

We always have to have our superheroes make an appearance watching from Dallas, Texas
0:07:10 – 0:07:15

We do have okay. We've got
0:07:15 – 0:07:18

Ajnab who is a Romero who's tuning in from the Philippines Nash's in Red Deer excellent
0:07:18 – 0:07:24

Harlow's in Hinton. This is great. We got a really really good group of people Jordan's in Edmonton cool deep car is
0:07:24 – 0:07:32

Core is West task one. Let's see. Yes mark from the Philippines and Ali is up in Grand Prairie
0:07:32 – 0:07:40

We got multiple people from Grand Prairie. All right, so lots of
0:07:40 – 0:07:43

Isaac's over in Brampton and
0:07:43 – 0:07:46

John Lin's Calgary. Okay, I'm gonna need to stop there's so many people watching live here
0:07:46 – 0:07:50

But we do have Lord issues tuning in from Peru. Awesome to have you
0:07:50 – 0:07:54

It's so great to be here and just try to share a little bit of information now
0:07:54 – 0:07:58

I want your your feedback on what you think and how you feel
0:07:58 – 0:08:02

About these changes now that we've had about 24 hours or so to kind of digest them in our meeting today
0:08:02 – 0:08:08

Igor and I are going to cover a little bit about the the overview of the AI and P changes
0:08:08 – 0:08:14

Then we're gonna talk about the new expression of interest system the key points
0:08:15 – 0:08:19

We're gonna hit on the points grid, which I know you guys are curious about what's going on here. I better get Igor in here
0:08:19 – 0:08:26

I've gotten a body double here working. Just give me a second. We'll pull Igor in on here. Yes
0:08:26 – 0:08:32

We did it here. Yeah, I was setting this up before he joined and then he just got in like two minutes before we went live
0:08:32 – 0:08:38

Okay, so we've got that we're gonna talk about the points grid
0:08:38 – 0:08:42

We're gonna talk about because some of the key differences from the previous system and this is important because some people are asking
0:08:42 – 0:08:48

Why do they you know not give any more points for people that have higher than a CLB 6?
0:08:48 – 0:08:54

Why are people with more work experience?
0:08:54 – 0:08:56

You know all counted the same once you hit 12 months and this all ties back to the previous system and I'll explain that as we
0:08:56 – 0:09:04

Go forward because I asked these questions to the officials myself
0:09:04 – 0:09:07

We'll take a detailed look at the specific streams because the streams haven't disappeared just whether or not you're gonna get to apply to them
0:09:07 – 0:09:15

That's what's changed
0:09:15 – 0:09:16

We're gonna talk about essential tips
0:09:16 – 0:09:18

Obviously once we give you the foundation then we're gonna talk about some essential tips that you guys need to understand when you're doing this
0:09:18 – 0:09:24

And then obviously what does this mean for the future?
0:09:24 – 0:09:29

What do you have to take into consideration? What are the challenges you're gonna face right now?
0:09:29 – 0:09:33

Then obviously future outlook predictions and then we'll wrap it up with a conclusion and Q&A
0:09:34 – 0:09:39

So this is kind of the roadmap of what we're gonna be talking about today. So as
0:09:39 – 0:09:44

An overview of the AIP changes. I want to flip over here. I should have Igor here with me
0:09:44 – 0:09:50

Yes, he is. Okay, and let's adjust the screen. So it fits just a little bit better
0:09:50 – 0:09:54

I want to point out something that Igor worked his little tail off here our immigration blog
0:09:54 – 0:10:00

And if you look here, I did one on the LMI a changes about
0:10:00 – 0:10:05

Four or five days ago, but right here
0:10:05 – 0:10:08

Igor did a very comprehensive blog post on all of this
0:10:08 – 0:10:12

he gave a really really good breakdown of how this all played out and
0:10:12 – 0:10:17

And and so I encourage you to go check out this detailed blog post that that Igor put together and there's just a ton of
0:10:17 – 0:10:25

information
0:10:25 – 0:10:27

Just just a walk. You can see it's a nice long
0:10:27 – 0:10:30

Fulsome blog post with just about everything that you could you could ever imagine
0:10:30 – 0:10:34

So go check that out. That'll form a foundation of what we're talking about today, but just to kick things off Igor, so
0:10:34 – 0:10:41

Give the viewers because I know you're only gonna be here with me for a little bit. Give them a little bit
0:10:41 – 0:10:47

You know a little bit of a history about this these changes and how they came about
0:10:47 – 0:10:52

Yeah, so essentially we've seen an evolution of the Alberta opportunity stream and
0:10:53 – 0:10:58

We are the West so if for those people who are the fans of the cowboy movies, this is the wild wild West and
0:10:58 – 0:11:07

Things were wild in here. So everyone could apply for the provincial nomination
0:11:07 – 0:11:12

Program in Alberta. There was no pretty much no restrictions, right?
0:11:12 – 0:11:18

So if you meet the minimum eligibility criteria submit your application and then your application will be processed. Yes the a u.s
0:11:18 – 0:11:26

for example had a
0:11:26 – 0:11:28

disclaimer saying that
0:11:28 – 0:11:30

The submission of the application does not guarantee that the province will process it. It's just mere expression of interest
0:11:30 – 0:11:38

so province was under no obligation to do anything with your application even if you pay the fee and
0:11:38 – 0:11:43

So essentially it was possible that you could submit an application and it would be pending for months and months and you would not hear
0:11:43 – 0:11:50

Back, but in practice did we hear about stories of people who submitted their application and waited for years?
0:11:50 – 0:11:56

Probably no at least not in our firm
0:11:56 – 0:11:59

So essentially the idea was as long as you meet the criteria
0:11:59 – 0:12:03

Submit an application. We're gonna process it then
0:12:03 – 0:12:07

We had the war in Ukraine a lot of Ukrainians came over
0:12:07 – 0:12:12

When many of them started considering where do they go? Do they go to Alberta? Do they go to Toronto or Vancouver and
0:12:13 – 0:12:20

Those were the same questions that every other immigrants would pose before them, right?
0:12:20 – 0:12:25

Like where do they go to study would they go to Toronto where the OMP is just ridiculous
0:12:25 – 0:12:31

The competition is crazy
0:12:31 – 0:12:34

the requirements for the employer are just over-the-top would they go to the
0:12:34 – 0:12:38

British Columbia where the employer must register with the province and
0:12:38 – 0:12:42

The restrictions are even harder than in Alberta right now. So Alberta was this
0:12:42 – 0:12:47

Wild West where people would go just to
0:12:47 – 0:12:50

benefit from this most liberal provincial nominee program, even though we are a conservative province and
0:12:50 – 0:12:57

Essentially the province had to fix something
0:12:57 – 0:13:00

So they they had this huge influx of the applications and they understood that they could not process everyone the province
0:13:00 – 0:13:06

gets only a certain number of
0:13:06 – 0:13:09

of nominations that they can issue per year and the federal government determines how many
0:13:10 – 0:13:15

Nominations the province can extend in a year. And so with the huge spike in the population
0:13:15 – 0:13:22

So right now just Calgary alone is 1.6 million people. So that's the fourth largest city in Canada
0:13:22 – 0:13:28

39% of Calgary population identified themselves as minorities
0:13:28 – 0:13:34

so that's just the statistics that I'm pulling in from today's meeting and SILA right where we talked about the economic development in Alberta and
0:13:34 – 0:13:41

Essentially Alberta figure out like Alberta is not made of rubber right? It cannot shrink and extend
0:13:41 – 0:13:47

Indefinitely and so they had to figure out the way how to restrict those people who could submit their applications
0:13:47 – 0:13:53

So they decided to put a pause on the intake in February and then they announced that
0:13:53 – 0:13:59

Starting June, they will be conducting only certain number
0:14:00 – 0:14:05

They will be taking in only a certain number of the applications
0:14:05 – 0:14:09

I think it's about 430 applications for the Alberta opportunity stream and they would open the intake just one month one day in a month
0:14:09 – 0:14:18

Essentially what that created was the race to file system
0:14:18 – 0:14:22

So you have thousands and tens of thousands of people sitting on the Alberta opportunity website all at once
0:14:22 – 0:14:29

Clicking their refresh button and all crashing the websites at once and the website would be dead for hours and hours
0:14:29 – 0:14:37

some people would get in and we're lucky to submit their application, but
0:14:37 – 0:14:42

essentially, it was just a
0:14:42 – 0:14:45

it was a debacle right we wrote the whole blog post talking about the technical challenges and the
0:14:45 – 0:14:51

Disadvantages of this race to file system and people felt that the system is not fair
0:14:51 – 0:14:57

Some applicants would have 10 computers trying to get in some some people would not have access to reliable internet
0:14:58 – 0:15:05

It was not fair and the province also understood it. They had consultations with lawyers. They had consultations with
0:15:05 – 0:15:11

Stakeholders and they had to fix it and then they decided to pause the intake again and they
0:15:11 – 0:15:17

Jump in here Igor. I'll jump in here quick. So so over the years
0:15:17 – 0:15:21

I've been heavily involved with the Canadian Bar Association
0:15:21 – 0:15:23

And one of the things that we do is we advocate on behalf of all of you
0:15:23 – 0:15:28

We you know, it's all a volunteer kind of role. I served on the the South Alberta section CBA
0:15:28 – 0:15:35

I was the chair for the South Alberta section and I I got involved in the national executive and I worked my way through and
0:15:35 – 0:15:41

I was a national chair of the Canadian Bar Association and much of what we did was to advocate on behalf of you
0:15:41 – 0:15:47

So sometimes the government will roll out programs or do things that they just don't do what the government thinks
0:15:47 – 0:15:53

They're gonna do or they create some unfairness or injustice to a certain segment of the applicants or they're just not
0:15:53 – 0:16:00

It's it's not
0:16:00 – 0:16:02

accomplishing the design that it was really designed to do because they weren't aware of something that was happening on the ground because the government
0:16:02 – 0:16:07

officials don't see necessarily what you're
0:16:07 – 0:16:10

Experiencing on your end of say even the new portal that they've created and so the expression of interest portal
0:16:10 – 0:16:17

so they don't know so ultimately
0:16:17 – 0:16:19

That the a bunch of lawyers within our Canadian Bar Association
0:16:20 – 0:16:24

were able to connect with the Alberta advantage immigration program in the summer after the race to file started and
0:16:24 – 0:16:31

We're able to organize a meeting with them and say hey you need to be aware of this people
0:16:31 – 0:16:36

Blocking spots and trying to sell them you need to be aware of the problems with the technology that some people are experiencing
0:16:36 – 0:16:43

This race to file is not accomplishing what you need to do and my recommendation to them was you need to pause it
0:16:43 – 0:16:48

Lots of people are like no, no, no, don't pause, but they needed to pause it
0:16:49 – 0:16:52

They needed to figure something out and kudos to the Alberta advantage immigration program because in a relatively short period of time
0:16:52 – 0:16:58

They whipped off a new expression of interest portal
0:16:58 – 0:17:00

I'd love to see IRCC turn around with the millions of dollars that they've given
0:17:00 – 0:17:04

You know to the department from our tax dollars to develop a system. That is really it's quite effective
0:17:04 – 0:17:13

So we'll see you guys will all see on September 30th what it looks like
0:17:13 – 0:17:16

But I'm really impressed really impressed. So at the end of the day
0:17:17 – 0:17:20

We had a very positive discussions with the province and they agreed to pause it and I said to them look
0:17:20 – 0:17:26

You're not reinventing the wheel here
0:17:26 – 0:17:28

British Columbia and Ontario and other provinces have consistently had more people
0:17:28 – 0:17:33

You know that want to apply than their spots
0:17:33 – 0:17:35

And so the only fair way to do it is through some form of point system that targets
0:17:35 – 0:17:41

Individuals that the province really needs at least the ones that they feel are a priority and this is the one thing
0:17:41 – 0:17:46

That that we will get to in just a little bit
0:17:47 – 0:17:49

So stay tuned and I will answer why the grid is the way it is
0:17:49 – 0:17:53

When if you just look at it, it doesn't doesn't make sense. So
0:17:53 – 0:17:57

Yes, so once again the province decided, okay, we're gonna pause it. We're gonna make changes. So flipping it back to you Igor
0:17:57 – 0:18:04

So after the race, yeah, then we're kind of August 7th comes
0:18:04 – 0:18:07

yeah, August 7 comes and on August 7th, they announced that from now on the
0:18:07 – 0:18:13

Alberta Advantage immigration program as we know it will cease to exist at least for some time so they will pause all intake
0:18:13 – 0:18:20

All intakes for at least until September 30th
0:18:20 – 0:18:24

And so as we approach September 30th, obviously more details become known and on
0:18:24 – 0:18:30

September 23rd just yesterday Alberta Opportunity Street, Alberta Advantage immigration program. Forgive me
0:18:30 – 0:18:36

released their points grid system breakdown and
0:18:36 – 0:18:41

They explained how they will assign points to all candidates and mark you actually raised a really important
0:18:42 – 0:18:48

Aspect here that with the previous versions of the Alberta Advantage immigration program
0:18:48 – 0:18:55

specifically Alberta Opportunity Stream the province would get
0:18:55 – 0:18:59

thousands of applications from people working in industries or occupations that the province was not really looking for it is
0:18:59 – 0:19:08

Sort of resembled what you had with the expert century system when as long as you had the minimum requirements
0:19:08 – 0:19:14

You can submit an application right but for the expert century
0:19:14 – 0:19:17

stream for the expert century program
0:19:17 – 0:19:21

Expert century system based programs. I'm sorry
0:19:21 – 0:19:25

You had to be working in a skilled occupation. So that was the minimum requirement for your job here in Alberta as long as you
0:19:25 – 0:19:34

Don't work on the list of ineligible occupations you could apply and so that created a massive problem for the for the province and
0:19:36 – 0:19:44

With this rollout of the new expression of interest they they solve this problem like it's not on the surface, but they actually do
0:19:44 – 0:19:53

essentially they will now be in control of who they want to see in the pool of applicants and
0:19:53 – 0:19:59

Like they will have the pool of candidates and the pool of applicants. So don't confuse those two things
0:19:59 – 0:20:04

so mark, I will probably then give the floor back to you because
0:20:05 – 0:20:08

You will be leading the agenda. I'm just yeah. No. No, that's fine. Igor. Thank you. That's exactly where we're at
0:20:08 – 0:20:15

So yeah, so in my meeting earlier today, we talked about some of these issues
0:20:15 – 0:20:19

And so those of you who have been watching we're able to see that on the government website on their updates page
0:20:19 – 0:20:24

They gave a very very quick overview of what was to come not a lot of detail
0:20:24 – 0:20:29

But enough at least to hit the high points and the high points is the worker express
0:20:29 – 0:20:36

Expression of interest points grid and if you look here, you'll see that there's no fee obviously for submitting an expression of interest
0:20:36 – 0:20:43

So anybody can submit whatever they want and one thing I want to point out that people sometimes don't understand
0:20:43 – 0:20:48

Candidates will self-declare information about themselves when you complete this when you complete and you go into the new
0:20:48 – 0:20:56

online worker expression of interest form in the portal and I'll just point out here just at the end if you have not yet and
0:20:58 – 0:21:05

This is I'm jumping ahead a little bit here. We're not keeping any secrets
0:21:05 – 0:21:09

You want to make sure that you have your Alberta CA account set up. But as you go through this you will see
0:21:09 – 0:21:15

that
0:21:15 – 0:21:17

that there is no purpose and
0:21:17 – 0:21:20

Really no advantage to racing as fast as you can to get your expression of interest in
0:21:20 – 0:21:25

So we know that they're gonna allow a number of intakes and we'll we read about this a little bit later
0:21:25 – 0:21:30

You can see here no rush to submit
0:21:30 – 0:21:32

They likely won't conduct their first pool until mid or late October
0:21:32 – 0:21:37

If you go and you take a look at this closer, you can kind of figure out what might be coming for October
0:21:37 – 0:21:43

It's not rocket science
0:21:43 – 0:21:45

Some of the if you look at the allocations and I know I'm jumping all over the place, but whatever
0:21:45 – 0:21:50

Sometimes things just one thing flows into another but some people are asking well, what are they gonna do?
0:21:51 – 0:21:56

Are they gonna do an Albert opportunity stream?
0:21:56 – 0:21:58

are they gonna do other areas like which which one is going to be the first one that they announce and
0:21:58 – 0:22:04

So if you look at this and you look at the number of spots total number of nominations issued
0:22:04 – 0:22:10

Okay, so we know for the Albert opportunity stream. They've already issued over four thousand
0:22:10 – 0:22:14

They have the availability of about five thousand three hundred and ninety three if you go down and you see here
0:22:14 – 0:22:20

How many are actually unprocessed or still in the queue? We have two thousand four hundred and fifty five
0:22:20 – 0:22:26

So what does that mean?
0:22:26 – 0:22:28

That means that they already have enough before they even start to fill the AOS stream
0:22:28 – 0:22:33

So those of you who are thinking okay, we're gonna have you know
0:22:33 – 0:22:37

These big streams and draws and and we're gonna be raring to go
0:22:37 – 0:22:40

Well, don't hold your breath too quickly because it's unlikely they're gonna do an AOS right away
0:22:40 – 0:22:46

I suspect that they're probably gonna look to one of the other streams if you look at look at tourism and hospitality stream
0:22:46 – 0:22:52

Okay, how many applications are in the queue? Do you guys see that eight eight as of like two months ago?
0:22:52 – 0:22:59

I guess yeah over two months ago, July 9th, 2024. That's the date that they sorry
0:22:59 – 0:23:04

That's the date that people were submitting applications
0:23:04 – 0:23:07

So basically this is almost in real time
0:23:07 – 0:23:09

So eight and if you go back up here and you can see tourism and hospitality this 392 that have already been processed
0:23:09 – 0:23:16

so for this year
0:23:16 – 0:23:18

It sure looks like there's room for this one, right?
0:23:18 – 0:23:21

And if you look at the row renewal stream, you can see there's thirteen hundred ninety four process
0:23:21 – 0:23:26

They only have nineteen hundred and if you scroll down here, you can see there's well over that many already in the pool
0:23:26 – 0:23:32

So what I'm trying to get at with all of this is that they will start their their rounds for sure
0:23:32 – 0:23:38

I'll just jump back to the main announcement here
0:23:38 – 0:23:40

They will start this but I suspect it's probably going to start with the the streams where they have not filled their quotas
0:23:40 – 0:23:48

So watch for that. So yes get your expression of interest in quickly like do it, but it's not a race
0:23:48 – 0:23:54

So do it right and the other thing candidates will self-declare information about themselves. What does that mean?
0:23:54 – 0:24:00

Well, you guys know the expression of interest and I'll just jump over here
0:24:00 – 0:24:05

You know that the expression the express entry process when you create your profile
0:24:05 – 0:24:09

You actually have to have a language number
0:24:09 – 0:24:11

Associate like a details about the language tests
0:24:11 – 0:24:14

You need to have your educational credential assessments the numbers the dates all those things and if you don't have them
0:24:14 – 0:24:19

You're not going to be able to submit. Well, I can tell you guys that the expression of interest system right now
0:24:19 – 0:24:24

We will see how it rolls out
0:24:24 – 0:24:26

But when they say self-declare information, it's it's possible that people could
0:24:26 – 0:24:32

Put in fake information and get an expression of interest
0:24:32 – 0:24:36

But my goodness, you better be able to support everything that you put in there
0:24:37 – 0:24:41

the province of Alberta has much more time to look at these applications than IRCC and
0:24:41 – 0:24:48

If you put anything in your expression of interest and I'll jump back here that isn't true in your attempt to self-declare
0:24:48 – 0:24:54

Let's say for example Igor, I'll give an example for people who are watching
0:24:54 – 0:24:57

Let's say you have not yet had a chance to write your language test
0:24:57 – 0:25:01

But you want to get your application in right away on September 30th when it opens up
0:25:01 – 0:25:07

So you say well, I only need I'll just jump all over the place here. Why not?
0:25:07 – 0:25:12

I only need for example with my friend my language. I only need a 6 CLB 6 or higher. That's it
0:25:12 – 0:25:19

Well, I know I'm gonna score higher than that or someone for instance who has a language test that's expired
0:25:19 – 0:25:25

You you do not want to just put yeah
0:25:25 – 0:25:29

I've got a 6 do you what I mean?
0:25:29 – 0:25:30

Because they don't care they don't care if it's any higher than this
0:25:30 – 0:25:34

They don't all they care is that it's 6 or higher. I'll explain in a little bit why that is
0:25:34 – 0:25:38

But ultimately the the thing to remember here is that the province has a lot of time to look at this and if you if they
0:25:38 – 0:25:45

Look like you're maybe not doing things properly or you know
0:25:45 – 0:25:48

You're you're just putting down the CLB 6 and then writing the test quick and hoping you can catch it up
0:25:48 – 0:25:53

Mm-hmm. Do not do that
0:25:53 – 0:25:55

They will see they will identify and they'll shut you down. Yeah
0:25:55 – 0:25:59

It's a little bit easier to guess your scores on your language test, but it's a little more complicated to guess the language test
0:26:00 – 0:26:08

report form number so
0:26:08 – 0:26:11

Essentially, we've seen this in extra century applications
0:26:11 – 0:26:15

but clients would put fake test report number just to be able to create a profile and then the officer at
0:26:15 – 0:26:23

The EAPR stage would ask for that original test report form and the applicant would not be able to produce that
0:26:23 – 0:26:30

so the officer would rightfully suspect that the applicant misrepresented and
0:26:30 – 0:26:35

you just don't want to come up with fake information because that would be misrepresentation with all the
0:26:35 – 0:26:40

Consequences that I don't even want to talk about here just to not the ruin the the yeah
0:26:40 – 0:26:46

The good atmosphere of this life. Yeah
0:26:46 – 0:26:48

Well, this is that's a good point Igor and what I want people to understand is the expression of interest
0:26:49 – 0:26:53

You know that like whatever you put in there
0:26:53 – 0:26:57

You're gonna have to support it with documentation and one thing I know is that they went as quickly as they could
0:26:57 – 0:27:04

To generate something so that they could keep the applications coming. So is this expression of interest portal?
0:27:04 – 0:27:11

Is it is it a finished product? No
0:27:11 – 0:27:14

Okay, it's kind of one of those MVPs minimum viable product and is there doing all they can to kind of get it rolled out?
0:27:14 – 0:27:21

Which I'm really impressed with with how well they did really compared to the debacle of IRCC
0:27:21 – 0:27:27

Like I think about the the h-1b open work permit holder application process. Oh my goodness. What what a disaster
0:27:27 – 0:27:34

Those of you who went through that or were involved in it. It was just a mess, but I was really impressed
0:27:34 – 0:27:39

Excuse me, so it may be that they don't even ask for numbers it may be I don't know and
0:27:42 – 0:27:47

But the reality is because they they don't really care and if you think Igor in the other applications for AOS
0:27:47 – 0:27:54

They didn't ask for actual numbers. I don't think I think all they asked was if you had it and then you uploaded it as
0:27:54 – 0:28:02

A part of your application you can maybe think but I'm not sure if they even asked like IRCC does for the actual form number
0:28:02 – 0:28:10

I think it was just have you written a language test?
0:28:10 – 0:28:12

And I think basically what what I got from my meeting today and obviously none of the confidential stuff
0:28:12 – 0:28:20

That was that was shown
0:28:20 – 0:28:22

Like will I talk about but but one of the messages that they did get acrossed is that that
0:28:22 – 0:28:29

You know, it's possible people could enter answers in that would otherwise make them ineligible for programs
0:28:29 – 0:28:36

But it wouldn't stop them from completing at this stage. Anyways, the entire
0:28:36 – 0:28:41

expression of interest in submitting it and
0:28:41 – 0:28:44

it was interesting because
0:28:44 – 0:28:46

One of the things that people are so fixated and I know people already have questions and I'll answer this
0:28:46 – 0:28:51

Indirectly, but if you look at the point system right here
0:28:51 – 0:28:55

many of the other provinces it's it's live or die by these points and
0:28:55 – 0:29:01

Whoever has the highest point threshold is is, you know, basically, they're the ones that are going to to succeed
0:29:02 – 0:29:09

but one of the things that was made abundantly clear to me is that the province when they do these
0:29:09 – 0:29:16

these expression of interest this points are only one factor in their decision to extend a
0:29:16 – 0:29:24

Notification of interest well to extend like a yeah a notification of interest or an invitation whatever they're gonna call it
0:29:25 – 0:29:32

To a person the points are only one factor you guys so you could technically have a hundred points and
0:29:32 – 0:29:40

They not nominate you or give you an invitation to to apply to one of the programs
0:29:40 – 0:29:47

So do not get so hung up on here and I know in their discussions
0:29:47 – 0:29:53

They talk about a number of things and we'll we'll kind of zip through this kind of quick
0:29:53 – 0:29:56

But that's at a very high level
0:29:56 – 0:29:59

That's what I want to to just reiterate is that the points are not the be-all and end-all
0:29:59 – 0:30:03

So and mark we can probably even compare this to experts entry in very
0:30:03 – 0:30:09

It is very similar like for the experts entry the IRCC has flexibility
0:30:09 – 0:30:17

Whether they want to do an FSW draw or just the PNP draw or the CC draw they they get to choose the program
0:30:17 – 0:30:24

They want to do just the francophone draw nothing stops them from doing that
0:30:24 – 0:30:28

So they they developed the system that allows the maximum flexibility and that's what we have with
0:30:28 – 0:30:34

Alberta advantage immigration program
0:30:34 – 0:30:36

The number of points you get does not guarantee that they will issue the invitation because what if they are looking to fill in
0:30:36 – 0:30:43

specific occupations or
0:30:43 – 0:30:46

Industries with candidates they may do it like nothing
0:30:46 – 0:30:50

Nothing puts them under the obligation to issue
0:30:50 – 0:30:53

Invitations to every candidate who has 80 points or 90 points. They can do
0:30:53 – 0:30:59

Different programs like the hospitality stream, right?
0:30:59 – 0:31:04

Hospitality and tourism stream and we've talked about it. They can
0:31:04 – 0:31:08

limit and target specific candidates from
0:31:08 – 0:31:11

Every program program and that's what they talked about that. It's one thing that you can submit an expression of interest
0:31:12 – 0:31:18

through the AIIP
0:31:18 – 0:31:20

But you also have to meet the minimum eligibility requirements for the existing programs such as the AUS or tourism hospitality stream, etc
0:31:20 – 0:31:29

So it's it's very similar to how we have things going on with experts entry right now
0:31:29 – 0:31:35

Absolutely, and like Tony and other people like Kieran, they're all asking the same question, which is an old question
0:31:35 – 0:31:43

It's an old question
0:31:43 – 0:31:45

Designed for an old process at least not for Alberta
0:31:45 – 0:31:49

So understand you guys that it's not all about this
0:31:49 – 0:31:52

So technically Igor you could have someone and I want to reiterate that you could have someone
0:31:52 – 0:31:57

Who was drawn under the Alberta opportunity stream or I should say was eligible under the Alberta opportunity stream AOS
0:31:57 – 0:32:05

Who submitted this expression of interest who has?
0:32:05 – 0:32:09

100 points
0:32:09 – 0:32:11

who does not receive a
0:32:11 – 0:32:13

Notification of interest from the province it is entirely possible and if you look at the actual instructions
0:32:13 – 0:32:22

you can see they reiterate over and over again that workers will be scored and ranked using the grid and
0:32:22 – 0:32:31

Candidates who are six who successfully submit the expression of interest will be placed into the worker stream pool to be considered for selection
0:32:32 – 0:32:39

So the points themselves are not everything so they'll conduct ongoing draws from the pool
0:32:39 – 0:32:46

for specific worker streams and pathways and they can
0:32:46 – 0:32:51

They can absolutely indicate. Well this particular industry within AOS is what we're focusing on this draw
0:32:51 – 0:32:58

so if you are a
0:32:58 – 0:33:00

Healthcare worker, although there's a healthcare stream. I'm just using that as an example and you are through AOS
0:33:00 – 0:33:06

Well, we're only drawing people in this particular industry
0:33:06 – 0:33:09

So they have the ability to create
0:33:09 – 0:33:11

subcategories within AOS to target the people that they most feel are needed for the province and you can see the
0:33:11 – 0:33:19

AIP will select and invite candidates from the worker stream pool based on the candidates EOI
0:33:19 – 0:33:25

Score rankings you see and everybody's stuck on that. They're like, this is it?
0:33:26 – 0:33:30

this is it the rankings, but they but this is something that people don't understand and
0:33:30 – 0:33:35

Provincial labor market needs and priorities. This blows everything open just
0:33:35 – 0:33:41

Because they can literally target any person that they want they do not restrict themselves
0:33:41 – 0:33:49

But what they do by an expression of interest is allow themselves to have a measure
0:33:49 – 0:33:54

To at the first instance compare one candidate to another and then from there
0:33:55 – 0:34:01

They look at their occupation all these other little details the industry they're working in
0:34:01 – 0:34:07

What is the province really need right now? So understand that, you know a number of factors. Let's keep looking at this quickly
0:34:07 – 0:34:14

available AIP nominations well
0:34:14 – 0:34:17

If they don't have any more space, that's a factor then they'll move to another stream
0:34:17 – 0:34:23

And like I said, I wouldn't be surprised of hotel and hospitality. They've got room there, right?
0:34:23 – 0:34:28

And you can see application levels. So where they're at in terms of the you know, the processing and what they have in the queue
0:34:28 – 0:34:35

and then of course individuals
0:34:35 – 0:34:37

They'll receive the ITA an invitation by email in the same way that people do through the express entry streams
0:34:37 – 0:34:44

So if you're wondering well, how is this gonna play out? Oh
0:34:44 – 0:34:46

exactly similar to the express entry stream process where if they give you a notification of interest and
0:34:47 – 0:34:55

The only difference is in this case. You're submitting your expression of interest where with the express entry streams
0:34:55 – 0:35:00

They're passive you submit your profile to the express entry pool
0:35:00 – 0:35:03

And then the Alberta Advantage immigration program if they like you they send you a notification of interest
0:35:03 – 0:35:09

directly to your your
0:35:09 – 0:35:12

you get a notification through IRCC's portal and then you have a certain time period to respond and
0:35:13 – 0:35:18

It'll be very very similar a very similar process and you can mark. No. Yeah, I will have chicken
0:35:18 – 0:35:25

My is what he's gonna do. They're gonna mug him
0:35:25 – 0:35:30

Yeah, so it's getting a little late
0:35:30 – 0:35:33

My battery is about to die, but it was a pleasure to connect with everyone and discuss this important topic
0:35:33 – 0:35:39

Like I invite everyone just to go to our website and check out the blog post. It's really important
0:35:40 – 0:35:46

if we will do another video talk in the detail about the
0:35:46 – 0:35:50

Expression of interest system. So mark, I will I will leave and I will leave sounds good or leading the life
0:35:50 – 0:35:57

So, thank you everyone and I'll see you later
0:35:57 – 0:35:59

You bet bye. Bye. No problem. Take care. All right. We'll let Igor slip away
0:35:59 – 0:36:04

So basically what I'm just trying to understand is that it's not as rigid as you think
0:36:04 – 0:36:09

So when you submit an expression of interest, they look at a number of different factors now built into the points grid
0:36:09 – 0:36:15

Which is probably as good a time as any to slide over here and and to actually look at it
0:36:15 – 0:36:20

I'll just take Igor and we'll just drop him right off of here
0:36:20 – 0:36:23

When you're when you're actually looking at the point grid here
0:36:23 – 0:36:27

I'll expand myself here there when you're looking at the point grid. You will see that. Yes, there are a number of
0:36:27 – 0:36:33

Factors that they look at and they assign points to them
0:36:34 – 0:36:37

But if you look at the qualifications for the programs that still their underlying rationale
0:36:37 – 0:36:43

They still feel that once a person meets the eligibility threshold for most of the programs
0:36:43 – 0:36:48

Which is often one year of Canadian work experience
0:36:48 – 0:36:51

Then they don't really care to them and for their purposes someone who has three years of Canadian of work experience
0:36:51 – 0:36:58

Let's say right in Alberta is no
0:36:58 – 0:37:00

Necessarily better candidate for them than someone who has 12 months and that's why when you're looking at this
0:37:01 – 0:37:06

If we just jump down to work experience, that's why it says 12 or more months
0:37:06 – 0:37:09

Everybody will get the same 11 points. So and then 6 to 11 months. What is 6 to 11?
0:37:09 – 0:37:16

Well, there are some programs that are 6 months if you're a post-grad work permit holder and others
0:37:16 – 0:37:22

Then they would fall into that realm if they wanted to apply a little bit earlier and it's interesting
0:37:22 – 0:37:28

one thing we don't know is if
0:37:28 – 0:37:30

Someone is at the 11 month period and they fill in the information in their expression of interest and then they keep working
0:37:30 – 0:37:37

Does it automatically roll over to 11 like Express Entry does? Well, I have to assume that it probably does
0:37:37 – 0:37:44

I'm I'm pretty confident the province of Alberta when they develop this it's sophisticated enough to do this
0:37:44 – 0:37:50

But we'll just have to see but let's just start from the top and let's whip through this
0:37:50 – 0:37:54

but as we go through here, I just want to just pull up a few a
0:37:54 – 0:37:59

Few comments people are the the viewers and listeners have have been really patient
0:37:59 – 0:38:04

But I want to give just a couple shoutouts to some of the questions
0:38:04 – 0:38:07

Three crafty kids says I filed under the rural program as an outlander now, they're mostly rejecting outlanders
0:38:07 – 0:38:14

Well, and that's true like because there's so many people in Canada
0:38:14 – 0:38:17

They they can pull from individuals that are already living and working in Canada that people outside of Canada
0:38:17 – 0:38:23

They just they just don't have
0:38:23 – 0:38:25

Like they want to take care of people in Canada first and it's messy guys. It's messy
0:38:25 – 0:38:32

Okay, let's see what else we have here
0:38:32 – 0:38:36

Joe says hey marketing or what do you expect on the first draw from this new system? I think I told you guys
0:38:36 – 0:38:41

I think it's probably where there's room which is tourism right in hospitality. That's my that's my bet
0:38:41 – 0:38:47

Jordan, so that's that's my bet Joe
0:38:47 – 0:38:50

Um
0:38:50 – 0:38:52

Okay, so
0:38:52 – 0:38:54

Jordan says hi
0:38:54 – 0:38:56

I'm working with an Alberta employer on a closed work permit from the last month and have a valid express engine problem
0:38:56 – 0:39:01

So can I apply for this expression of interest? Please clarify? Okay, that's a great segue
0:39:01 – 0:39:05

So let's go back and let's just take a look at some of the the factors that they look at
0:39:05 – 0:39:09

So when you're submitting your expression of interest
0:39:09 – 0:39:12

There really isn't barriers to submitting it that I'm aware of
0:39:12 – 0:39:16

When you're going to submit it, you're gonna be able to answer the questions. And if we look specifically at work experience in Alberta
0:39:17 – 0:39:24

there's an option here less than six months which would be you if you just started if you're currently employed in Alberta and
0:39:24 – 0:39:33

It says it includes all experience accumulated in Canada and abroad
0:39:33 – 0:39:37

So total work experience if you have less than six months or six to eleven months or twelve months or more
0:39:37 – 0:39:44

And this is for remember this here is work experience that's included in Canada and abroad
0:39:44 – 0:39:50

So you can that totals it's kind of like a duplication. You can have a maximum of 11 points
0:39:50 – 0:39:55

Well, if you've never worked anywhere but in Canada, then you could get three points for that work experience in Canada
0:39:55 – 0:40:01

It includes both experience in Alberta and other provinces or territories in Canada, not Alberta
0:40:01 – 0:40:07

I guess they're just feeling like they have to explain that twice and award higher points between the two scores
0:40:07 – 0:40:12

So they will look at this collectively you can get a maximum of 21 points total and you can see here
0:40:12 – 0:40:19

Six months or more work experience in Alberta will give you ten points
0:40:19 – 0:40:24

So it'll give you the maximum points
0:40:24 – 0:40:26

Six months or more work experience in another province or territory not Alberta is not as valuable
0:40:26 – 0:40:31

Because if you worked in Alberta and you've got at least six months
0:40:31 – 0:40:34

it's more likely you're gonna stick around than someone who just parachutes in gets the expression of interest in gets a
0:40:34 – 0:40:40

Notification like an invitation to apply and then they get their nomination and then take off back to Ontario right from where they came
0:40:40 – 0:40:48

But there's a number of factors that that kick in when they're doing these assessments, but these are just some of the points
0:40:48 – 0:40:53

That are awarded to individuals to try to determine if they have the basic information
0:40:53 – 0:40:59

Needed to be able to be considered realistically for nomination
0:40:59 – 0:41:03

Let's just start and let's just go through this. I've been jumping around a little bit so you can see education here
0:41:03 – 0:41:09

They do distinguish between doctoral degree and master's degree
0:41:09 – 0:41:13

Okay, and then it says location of highest level of education completed in Canada
0:41:13 – 0:41:18

So if you have Canadian education and this is overall education, so it doesn't ask it doesn't really distinguish here
0:41:18 – 0:41:25

But if it's completed in Alberta, you're gonna get bonus points, which makes sense
0:41:25 – 0:41:29

once again work experience or any experience in Alberta is going to be valued more than just general Canadian experience and
0:41:29 – 0:41:35

Understand you guys that these few little differentiations these these difference in four points could make all the difference for
0:41:36 – 0:41:42

you know individuals when it comes down to
0:41:42 – 0:41:45

notifications of interest
0:41:45 – 0:41:48

It's possible, but remember Alberta is not bound just to these points. Remember that
0:41:48 – 0:41:54

Okay language you can see once again. We talked about this
0:41:54 – 0:41:58

Well the minimum some programs allow up to a full like is as low as a four
0:41:58 – 0:42:02

Well all they care about okay, they're based on the lowest score for all four language competencies on the test taken
0:42:03 – 0:42:09

So what it means is if you have a four in writing and you have a nine and everything else
0:42:09 – 0:42:14

Well, then you're gonna have to put four
0:42:14 – 0:42:17

right here as the threshold because all they're asking for is
0:42:17 – 0:42:22

The one lowest score of all the four things that you've taken interesting. Hey, it's kind of interesting, but that's what they're doing here
0:42:22 – 0:42:30

They'll score for both English and French and award the higher points between the two scores
0:42:30 – 0:42:35

So if you have both of them, they'll use whichever is hired as kind of the principle
0:42:35 – 0:42:39

And then as you go through here, you'll see if you do speak both you get bonus points once again
0:42:39 – 0:42:46

So as long as you have at least an NC LC or a CLB four or higher in both of them
0:42:46 – 0:42:52

You're gonna get the bonus three points and those little points make a difference and CLB four is not too hard
0:42:52 – 0:42:59

So, what do we tell people over and over the days of you know, the golden ages?
0:42:59 – 0:43:05

I described before francophone immigration are still here alive and well and even for the province of Alberta
0:43:05 – 0:43:11

And I think they've all received marching orders from the feds that they have to incorporate something that targets francophone
0:43:11 – 0:43:17

applicants
0:43:17 – 0:43:19

Individuals who are going even to Alberta who speak French have a leg up over people that just speak English even in Alberta
0:43:19 – 0:43:26

all right work experience like we talked about once you hit 12 months or more and this is include it includes all
0:43:27 – 0:43:32

Experience accumulated in Canada and abroad. So this is overseas experience as well
0:43:32 – 0:43:37

Really?
0:43:37 – 0:43:38

They're not giving a lot of points for someone who has three four or five six seven ten years
0:43:38 – 0:43:42

It comes down to do you have the minimum and that's good enough?
0:43:42 – 0:43:46

However, once again, there is bonus points for work experience in Canada. So you this could be double you've got one year in Canada
0:43:46 – 0:43:54

well, you get points for here 11 points and
0:43:54 – 0:43:57

Six or more if it's in Alberta, then you can get the other ten points if it's outside
0:43:57 – 0:44:02

Then you're just gonna get the six. Okay. I think you guys get that. We don't need to spend a lot of time
0:44:02 – 0:44:06

Interesting here, isn't it?
0:44:06 – 0:44:09

18 to 23 points 21 to 34 is five points
0:44:09 – 0:44:14

So this is now the sweet spot for Alberta unlike Express Entry where it caps at 29 then you start losing points
0:44:14 – 0:44:21

Here it's 34 and then it's not really a big loss
0:44:21 – 0:44:26

So 49 you get four and hey, look at this you guys even me old man
0:44:26 – 0:44:31

Mark who's turning 52 in one week. I would still get points. Oh, I love my province. Isn't that nice?
0:44:31 – 0:44:39

Okay family connection people were wondering for a long time. How do they even treat family connection?
0:44:39 – 0:44:46

Why do they even ask or care? We never hear about family draws
0:44:46 – 0:44:50

Well, it is a factor and if you have a family member who lives in Alberta
0:44:50 – 0:44:54

That's a big deal because there's more likely that you would then stay in Alberta yourself
0:44:54 – 0:44:59

And so there's eight whopping points
0:44:59 – 0:45:02

Do you see this eight points that is?
0:45:02 – 0:45:04

Attributed if you have a family member living in Alberta who is a Canadian citizen or permanent resident 18 years of age
0:45:04 – 0:45:10

Now remember it is restricted to a parent a grandparent a child a grandchild
0:45:10 – 0:45:17

Sibling but it goes out there
0:45:17 – 0:45:20

It goes out an uncle an aunt a niece or even a nephew now
0:45:20 – 0:45:25

It doesn't have cousin on there you guys so all of my good friends from India
0:45:25 – 0:45:30

Who's every member of their community is their cousin?
0:45:30 – 0:45:33

that doesn't count here so cousins are too far, but
0:45:33 – 0:45:37

Your cousin's parents who are siblings to your parents
0:45:38 – 0:45:42

Your parents do count so niece nephew uncle aunt sibling and the rest eight points. It's a big deal
0:45:42 – 0:45:50

Okay. Now guys this these economic factors are important
0:45:50 – 0:45:55

the whole underlying principle behind the Alberta advantage immigration program and all the PNPs is
0:45:55 – 0:46:03

That each candidate must demonstrate the ability to economically establish themselves in that province
0:46:03 – 0:46:10

So how do they determine that well Alberta is all about work permits and yes you guys
0:46:10 – 0:46:15

Yes, maintain status is still a thing
0:46:15 – 0:46:18

It's not disappearing now Alberta has agreed to participate with the feds and that narrow little program for people who were you know
0:46:18 – 0:46:26

Who fall under that exemption where you know, they'll agree to issue them a work permit
0:46:26 – 0:46:31

But aside from that narrow exemption, they're still expect you to maintain a valid work permit
0:46:31 – 0:46:37

So keep that in mind that hasn't changed
0:46:37 – 0:46:39

And as you look here
0:46:39 – 0:46:42

so a job offer for permanent full-time employment in Alberta could be a maximum of ten points and those points can come from
0:46:42 – 0:46:49

Six points here or up to five or more right here with the job offer and you can see there's other
0:46:49 – 0:46:56

Regulated occupation that's different. So we stay focused on this this just this chart here. So ten points you can see
0:46:58 – 0:47:05

for a permanent full-time job offer in Alberta and then
0:47:05 – 0:47:10

Six points if the job offer is to work and I should say let me rephrase this. So there's a maximum of 31 points
0:47:10 – 0:47:17

Maximum total points of 16 for the job offers which are this right here and then another five for the location
0:47:17 – 0:47:24

So just to break this down Alberta is big on rural
0:47:24 – 0:47:27

So if you live outside of Edmonton and Calgary and you can see it's right down here
0:47:27 – 0:47:33

Calgary census metropolitan area Edmonton, then you are not getting any points for your location
0:47:33 – 0:47:40

but if you're outside of those areas
0:47:40 – 0:47:42

Then you can get up to five points and a road renewal stream designated community or an other Alberta community
0:47:42 – 0:47:49

That's outside of Edmonton and Calgary essentially can get the five points for everywhere else
0:47:49 – 0:47:53

You can get a bonus five points and then if an individual has a job offer this ten points right here
0:47:53 – 0:48:00

There's not a lot of explanation, but this you guys is not
0:48:00 – 0:48:03

lmi a based so if you have just a regular open work permit and
0:48:03 – 0:48:08

There's an employer that supports you. It does not look on the surface
0:48:08 – 0:48:14

Let's say you're let's run us. Let's say you're on a spousal open work permit or you're on a postgrad work permit from a different province
0:48:14 – 0:48:21

Right now we don't see any restrictions on
0:48:21 – 0:48:26

Claiming those ten points for a job offer from the company. And once again, that's not an lmi a based job offer
0:48:26 – 0:48:33

This is a big deal before there were some limited exceptions to job offers. But ultimately the the
0:48:33 – 0:48:39

For open work permit holders with job offers that were limited exceptions, but generally it was employer specific work permits
0:48:40 – 0:48:46

So we'll see how this plays out. We don't have a hundred percent confirmation
0:48:46 – 0:48:49

But it sure looks like you could get those maximum, you know ten points if your employers willing to do their part and support you
0:48:49 – 0:48:56

Okay
0:48:56 – 0:48:58

We went through this. We're just about done guys last job offer in a regulated occupation. Some people are confused about this
0:48:58 – 0:49:05

many professional occupations that designated occupations and trades are
0:49:06 – 0:49:10

regulated in Alberta
0:49:10 – 0:49:12

And if you have trade certification or a professional designation like you're a nurse or you are a welder
0:49:12 – 0:49:18

Then you can get an extra ten points. All right, so
0:49:18 – 0:49:22

Yeah, and and it's basically it says only those who have an Alberta job offer in a regulated occupation and
0:49:22 – 0:49:29

Who meet the requirements set out by the professional body or the apprenticeship and industry training? That's what a IT stands for for Alberta
0:49:29 – 0:49:37

Okay, so we don't need to really pay too much attention about the other stuff here
0:49:37 – 0:49:41

There will definitely be as you're filling out your profile
0:49:41 – 0:49:46

And submitting your expression of interest you will need to understand the primary line of business and understand the NAICS code
0:49:46 – 0:49:53

Which is different than NOC and select your own NOC
0:49:53 – 0:49:56

But at this stage, this is kind of a breakdown of the points. So we flip back here
0:49:56 – 0:50:02

I'll just remove Igor from here. So we've talked about just to recap everybody
0:50:02 – 0:50:08

We talked about a little bit of an overview of the changes. We've talked about the new expression of interest system
0:50:08 – 0:50:14

Remember, there's no fee and there's no rush to submit it on September 30th. Take your time
0:50:14 – 0:50:19

Make sure you get it, right
0:50:19 – 0:50:21

One thing I will point out that some people won't yet be aware of is that unlike Express Entry?
0:50:21 – 0:50:26

You will not have the ability to edit or modify your your expression of interest
0:50:26 – 0:50:32

you actually have to decline it or remove it delete it, whatever they call it in the portal and
0:50:32 – 0:50:37

Then resubmit a new one if you are making changes
0:50:37 – 0:50:41

All right, and that maybe is a hint that maybe it won't automatically update hard to know for certain. I guess we'll find out
0:50:41 – 0:50:49

Okay, let's see. What else we've got. Let's get to some more questions
0:50:50 – 0:50:53

you can see Shalias here says
0:50:53 – 0:50:56

Hi, Mark and Igor any idea?
0:50:56 – 0:50:58

What will be the passing points to be able to get an ITA on September 30th?
0:50:58 – 0:51:02

Do you think there will be queue again upon signing in your account? Thanks. No queues
0:51:02 – 0:51:06

No race to file make sure you've got your Alberta account and for those who are wondering
0:51:06 – 0:51:11

What is the Alberta account if we flip back here? Just go to the main. This is the the Alberta advantage updates page
0:51:11 – 0:51:18

This is where we have a little bit of a general overview of the details of the new
0:51:18 – 0:51:22

worker streams
0:51:22 – 0:51:24

Expression of interest you can go down here right here. And this is where you will click on your Alberta account
0:51:24 – 0:51:31

You'll go here
0:51:31 – 0:51:32

if you have not already done so and you will register for one of these it should only take about
0:51:32 – 0:51:37

10 minutes to do this and
0:51:37 – 0:51:39

Realistically, it's probably only going to take most people if you have all your documentation ready about 20 minutes
0:51:39 – 0:51:45

Maybe 25 minutes to submit and complete and submit your expression of interest
0:51:45 – 0:51:50

Okay, so remember this right here is where you're gonna get your access. You have to have that account
0:51:50 – 0:51:59

It's kind of like a GC key and then from there
0:51:59 – 0:52:01

You'll be able to submit your expression of interest and remember you could be inside Canada submit an expression of interest outside Canada
0:52:01 – 0:52:09

You could be in another province. You could be in Alberta
0:52:09 – 0:52:11

It's gonna be pretty open to submit it and then at the end of the day
0:52:11 – 0:52:15

You'll see, you know, really that it's still pretty hyper competitive for people who are already in Alberta. All right
0:52:15 – 0:52:21

Okay, let's go to a couple more questions here and then we'll jump in and I'll jump to a quick super chat
0:52:21 – 0:52:28

Okay, this is kind of out
0:52:28 – 0:52:31

Tamki this is out of the kind of the area
0:52:31 – 0:52:34

I think this is more of an express entry if my employer doesn't
0:52:34 – 0:52:38

Doesn't provide want to provide the reference letter for CEC and if I don't have any colleagues that would provide a letter
0:52:38 – 0:52:42

What are the options the onus is on you to prove it?
0:52:42 – 0:52:45

It's simple as that time guy you have an obligation to to prove it
0:52:45 – 0:52:49

And so in my course, which I think many of you are probably aware that I have my express entry course
0:52:49 – 0:52:54

I strongly strongly encourage you to subscribe to it in that course. I have a
0:52:54 – 0:52:59

document that I use specifically
0:52:59 – 0:53:02

to help
0:53:02 – 0:53:03

My basically the the people that are who've subscribed to it
0:53:03 – 0:53:08

Now, let me just jump back and I'll just show you I'll just show you a quick here. So we jump over here
0:53:08 – 0:53:13

So if you go to there's a link in the description, I think for this video, it'll take you here to
0:53:13 – 0:53:19

The the landing page for the express entry accelerator and in here I have an entire section
0:53:19 – 0:53:26

I'll just I'll just bring it up really quick
0:53:26 – 0:53:28

This is kind of the sponsor of this anyways
0:53:28 – 0:53:30

But I have a document
0:53:30 – 0:53:32

Mastering your document section and in here it breaks down all of the sections and this record of employment lesson 48 is
0:53:32 – 0:53:39

chock-full
0:53:39 – 0:53:41

Because I shouldn't have clicked on it. It is chock-full lesson 48 of
0:53:41 – 0:53:45

Instructions on what to do if you can't get the reference letter, so I encourage you to slide over there
0:53:45 – 0:53:50

But ultimately the wrong one here, but ultimately time guy
0:53:50 – 0:53:53

You're gonna it's gonna be tough if your employer won't give it to you. Do you have pay slips pay stubs?
0:53:53 – 0:53:58

Do you have bank deposits? Do you have an offer letter originally?
0:53:58 – 0:54:02

Do you have a termination letter or a relieving letter? Do you have a
0:54:02 – 0:54:06

Supervisors that are currently working for the company that would give you an affidavit
0:54:06 – 0:54:11

Do you have co-workers that are also willing to state what you did for the company, you know?
0:54:11 – 0:54:17

Those are things that you can look at but it's not easy when you do not have an employers willing to do that
0:54:17 – 0:54:23

Okay. All right focusing guys on the future. We're focusing exclusively on
0:54:23 – 0:54:27

On the Alberta advantage immigration program the expression of interest. Okay. Let's see. What else we have here. Any other questions?
0:54:28 – 0:54:35

There were a whole bunch. I
0:54:35 – 0:54:38

Think we already answered Jordan's question about working with an Alberta employer on a closed work permit from last month
0:54:38 – 0:54:45

I have a valid express entry problem. So can I apply you talked about this before earlier?
0:54:45 – 0:54:49

And yeah, like there's nothing stopping you from submitting that expression of interest
0:54:49 – 0:54:53

We talked about the passing mark
0:54:53 – 0:54:56

And and we've talked Nash. I'll bring this up for you
0:54:57 – 0:55:00

Nash says the expression of interest point grid makes no distinction between high of skill
0:55:00 – 0:55:04

Versus low skill work tier 1 and tier 5 can both count for 12 months experience
0:55:04 – 0:55:08

For example, that is true. So there isn't a lot of distinction but on the back end
0:55:08 – 0:55:13

Alberta the province will look at the industry
0:55:13 – 0:55:17

They will look at the labor market and they will determine based on that where the needs are
0:55:17 – 0:55:22

For these nominations which industries need more nominations which need less. So although on the surface, there's no restrictions
0:55:23 – 0:55:30

they intend to make that that opening kind of funnel as
0:55:30 – 0:55:34

wide as possible to capture as many people because they don't want someone who would be a good fit to not be able to
0:55:34 – 0:55:41

To be considered so they're gonna have a large large database of people that have expressed an interest and obviously
0:55:41 – 0:55:49

You know, that's how you start this whole process process. But in the end
0:55:49 – 0:55:53

Yeah in the end, they will make that call. All right
0:55:53 – 0:55:57

Okay, let's see. What else we've got everybody here. I'm just going through the past comments
0:55:57 – 0:56:02

All I appreciate everybody letting me know where they're tuning in from. I love to see how broadly this is broadcast
0:56:02 – 0:56:09

Okay, so Ahmed says let us know how to calculate the work experience, please and also the cutoff points
0:56:09 – 0:56:16

Okay, so the work experience is just simple. It's it's gonna be the same as it was before
0:56:16 – 0:56:21

Minimum of 30 hours per week, you know full-time paid all that kind of stuff
0:56:21 – 0:56:26

It's it's not gonna be any different than it was before for the Albert opportunity stream or the other programs
0:56:26 – 0:56:31

Okay, as far as cutoff points, well, we will ultimately see how it plays out
0:56:31 – 0:56:36

But remember the cutoff points are not the be-all and end-all like they will look at a number of different factors
0:56:36 – 0:56:43

Okay
0:56:44 – 0:56:46

Let's see here. We've got Lourdes says hi from Peru in the actual context
0:56:46 – 0:56:50

What stream pathway do you assess for a 50 year old people worth a high level of English? Now, am I exempt for trade?
0:56:50 – 0:56:56

Agreement to start our path to migrate. I'm gonna click on right here. Oh, I don't have my sound turned up
0:56:56 – 0:57:03

Bear with me here. I have to click on this
0:57:03 – 0:57:05

Which means slide over to our firm website and anyone who has any questions or needs assistance?
0:57:05 – 0:57:12

You can go straight to our firm website once you're here
0:57:12 – 0:57:15

It's easy book a consult speak to a lawyer which everyone works for you. And then from there
0:57:15 – 0:57:20

Excuse me
0:57:20 – 0:57:22

You can have the ability to book a one-on-one meeting with one of our our lawyers in the firm Alisha myself
0:57:22 – 0:57:29

Igor we're all here to provide assistance to you and I'm picking the wrong one again. Okay, let's keep zipping through here
0:57:29 – 0:57:37

Let's see. What else do we have next?
0:57:37 – 0:57:40

Next just sorting through all the questions. Okay. Here's a good one from Nash
0:57:41 – 0:57:46

How do you think they would decide on tie-breaking criteria given that multiple applications achieve similar EOI scores?
0:57:46 – 0:57:51

The tie-breaker is always going to be the other stuff. The tie-breaker is always going to be if we flip back here
0:57:51 – 0:57:58

It's going to be the other factors that they're looking for
0:57:58 – 0:58:01

okay, so when you're when like they said many times before when they're going through and doing the assessments they look at a number of
0:58:01 – 0:58:09

things including
0:58:09 – 0:58:10

Yes, the score ranking but labor market needs and priorities are big
0:58:10 – 0:58:15

That there is the distinction that is going to be the difference maker in my mind
0:58:15 – 0:58:21

Oh, and I keep pushing the wrong one here and I know what you're saying Nash. Okay?
0:58:21 – 0:58:25

Well, what if they're all identical and then they then and then they decide, you know, you've got two people that are identical
0:58:25 – 0:58:32

Usually people are not
0:58:32 – 0:58:34

Siamese twins usually their backgrounds are just slightly different and I think that's ultimately how they're going to do it
0:58:34 – 0:58:41

but they reserve the right even if people are identical to choose which one they want and
0:58:41 – 0:58:47

That's entirely within their purview
0:58:47 – 0:58:50

under their
0:58:50 – 0:58:52

bilateral agreements with the feds
0:58:52 – 0:58:54

Okay, let's see. What else is next. Oh, yeah
0:58:54 – 0:58:57

Puneet says when is the law enforcement stream coming? Yeah, the law enforcement stream. That's a real strange one that I don't know that
0:58:58 – 0:59:06

I don't know
0:59:06 – 0:59:07

Okay, let's see. What else we've got lots of predictions about the expression of interest
0:59:07 – 0:59:10

Okay cam says does the program have any special work permits allowed to enter the program like IRCC special measures issued open work permits
0:59:10 – 0:59:21

Are they in the program? No
0:59:21 – 0:59:23

Generally speaking if you have a nomination you can get an R 204 C letter which allows you to continue working
0:59:23 – 0:59:28

In some instances, but no, they're not just going to issue, you know any special measures
0:59:28 – 0:59:34

Ultimately people that are already working on any type of a special measure permit whether it's quit or otherwise
0:59:34 – 0:59:41

They will you know, they've had an opportunity and eligibility in the past and I do not see that changing
0:59:41 – 0:59:47

Okay
0:59:47 – 0:59:50

Okay, let's see this individual says what a two-year contract job in Alberta be eligible or does it need to be permanent?
0:59:51 – 0:59:57

well at the end of the day the employer is
0:59:57 – 1:00:00

expressing a desire to support you with the job offer and people many people already be working for their employer and
1:00:00 – 1:00:08

Many employers do have more temporal like two-year job offers, but remember
1:00:08 – 1:00:13

You're as a part of this PNP. You have an obligation to demonstrate that you can economically establish in Alberta
1:00:13 – 1:00:20

so the expectation would be yeah, it might be a two-year contract, but
1:00:20 – 1:00:23

The the expectation would be that you'd be able to extend that permit and the employer would support you
1:00:23 – 1:00:28

That's an interesting question tuna says do you have an expectation for other provinces will review their own points such as Ontario
1:00:28 – 1:00:36

I don't see that happening right now. They've been doing it for so long
1:00:36 – 1:00:39

They've kind of honed it down to what they feel is working
1:00:39 – 1:00:42

They could maybe tweak a little a few things here or there
1:00:42 – 1:00:46

But they've got a lot of flexibility within the human capital priority stream to you know
1:00:46 – 1:00:50

To kind of target the people that they want already, so I don't anticipate too many changes tuna to Ontario. That's for sure
1:00:50 – 1:00:57

Great question Sumit an open work permit hold to do Alberta job offers need to be supported by LMIA's at this stage
1:00:57 – 1:01:06

The answer is no it could change in the future. But at this stage the answer is no
1:01:06 – 1:01:10

See what else we have
1:01:10 – 1:01:14

Mark says so you don't have to pay the fee yet. If you're applying through the expression of interest, that's correct
1:01:15 – 1:01:20

There's no fee to submit an expression of interest
1:01:20 – 1:01:22

And mark just to confirm yes regardless of having two or three years
1:01:22 – 1:01:29

It doesn't matter based on the grid and as we indicate here if we slide back to the grid
1:01:29 – 1:01:34

You can see for work experience here
1:01:34 – 1:01:36

Once you hit you guys once you hit 12 or more months, then you've capped out. So anything more than that, you're not going to get
1:01:36 – 1:01:43

Yeah, you're not going to get those extra points
1:01:44 – 1:01:47

Well bolt basically you've reached the maximum number of points
1:01:47 – 1:01:51

Okay
1:01:51 – 1:01:54

Okay, here we go
1:01:54 – 1:01:59

Janelle says what if I have a master's degree at my home country and I finished a bachelor's degree in Alberta
1:01:59 – 1:02:04

What would be my points in location? Okay. Well, let's take a look. We can always sort this out. So
1:02:04 – 1:02:09

If we go back here, so it says here the highest level of education completed
1:02:10 – 1:02:15

So the highest level of education completed 12, if you have a master's degree, you're gonna get 10 points here
1:02:15 – 1:02:20

Location of highest level of education completed in Canada. Well, that's a good question
1:02:20 – 1:02:26

That's a really good question in this case here and understand. This is just a grid I would have to assume
1:02:26 – 1:02:33

Completed in another province or territory not Alberta. I don't know you would if you had a bachelor's degree right here
1:02:34 – 1:02:41

That's seven points. Then I have to assume that
1:02:41 – 1:02:45

The highest level of education completed in Canada if you completed it in Alberta, let's just see where you indicated
1:02:45 – 1:02:53

It doesn't say Oh degree in Alberta, then I think you still should be able to get those points
1:02:53 – 1:02:59

Yeah, it doesn't say it just says the location of the highest level of education completed in Canada
1:03:01 – 1:03:06

So that would assume that your bachelor's degree if you took a bachelor's which is interesting
1:03:06 – 1:03:11

That you'd still get those points if it was in Alberta. Okay
1:03:11 – 1:03:16

We'll keep zipping here. We're just about gonna wrap up here guys
1:03:16 – 1:03:19

I don't want to go too late. It's already 837. We've been going for about an hour here. Okay, let's see what else we have
1:03:19 – 1:03:27

Okay
1:03:30 – 1:03:32

Danny says if I got a US working working experiences, the points will be added
1:03:32 – 1:03:36

Well as you can see if we go back to the point grid and I think a lot of people's questions are going to be
1:03:36 – 1:03:40

Related to this if we go to the work history, you can see that it includes all experience in Canada and abroad
1:03:40 – 1:03:45

So the answer for here is yes
1:03:45 – 1:03:48

It's just these extra bonus points if you have worked in Canada
1:03:48 – 1:03:53

All right, what's next as we zip through
1:03:53 – 1:03:57

You
1:03:58 – 1:04:00

Okay, Brian says thank you for the job offer to be valid for AOS
1:04:00 – 1:04:04

It must be with a closed work permit that that depends not all
1:04:04 – 1:04:09

AOS
1:04:09 – 1:04:11

Job offers or work experience have to be closed work permits
1:04:11 – 1:04:15

Like for example, the quit open work permit is is open and available a postgrad work permit for individuals who have studied in Alberta
1:04:15 – 1:04:23

They also can count that
1:04:23 – 1:04:26

Can count that towards like that job offer now. Here's one thing. I want to point out
1:04:27 – 1:04:32

Okay, this is something that I could have said earlier, but these things kind of come to me
1:04:32 – 1:04:36

There's so much that I needed to talk about
1:04:36 – 1:04:38

Here's a very very interesting aspect of this and I'm not sure if it's actually if it's stated in here or not
1:04:38 – 1:04:45

Let's just see here. I don't know if it is
1:04:45 – 1:04:48

Confirm you meet the requirements for one or more streams. Okay, let's just highlight this
1:04:48 – 1:04:54

Okay, so we encourage you to take the following steps to prepare to submit a worker EOI confirm
1:04:54 – 1:04:59

You meet eligibility requirements for one or more a AIP work streams
1:04:59 – 1:05:02

So a couple things I can point out one is that you cannot submit more than one expression of interest at the same time
1:05:02 – 1:05:08

You can't do a worker and an entrepreneur one
1:05:08 – 1:05:11

It has to only one and if you have an old one and then you want to recreate a new one or make changes
1:05:11 – 1:05:17

You cancel the other one and start a new one
1:05:17 – 1:05:19

But here's the interesting part and I'm gonna go back here where everybody can see me
1:05:19 – 1:05:23

The interesting part is that ultimately you are not the one that's choosing which program you're going through
1:05:23 – 1:05:29

When you start off you're gonna have an ability to explain to some extent
1:05:29 – 1:05:34

You know you there's always gonna be an ability to to you know to
1:05:34 – 1:05:41

To you know decide which program you're eligible for because that's what it says right here on the sheet
1:05:41 – 1:05:46

It says you need to determine I'm trying not to I don't want to say anything that discloses anything that would have
1:05:46 – 1:05:52

You know been under the the non-disclosure agreement, but ultimately you yeah when it comes to eligibility
1:05:52 – 1:05:58

The Alberta advantage immigration program is always going to be the one that has the final decision on which program you're nominated under and that's always
1:05:58 – 1:06:06

Been the case. There's no there's nothing different about that
1:06:06 – 1:06:09

So you're gonna submit your expression of interest and then they're going to determine where you're gonna go and which one you're gonna qualify through
1:06:09 – 1:06:16

Okay, let's see here
1:06:16 – 1:06:18

Just trying to find anything that I have not yet otherwise answered from other people if I skip through like don't worry about that
1:06:20 – 1:06:26

Okay
1:06:26 – 1:06:30

Beza says I have a TS
1:06:30 – 1:06:32

2023 open work permit I live in Alberta and have been working here for seven months
1:06:32 – 1:06:36

Can I also be included in this program? Well, everybody can you can absolutely submit an expression of interest?
1:06:36 – 1:06:42

Okay, Tash says do you think co-op work experience in Alberta will count?
1:06:42 – 1:06:47

I personally don't think it will
1:06:47 – 1:06:49

But we'll see. I don't I don't know if they will have the same restriction on work experience gained while studying
1:06:49 – 1:06:56

I don't know, but I have to assume it's probably going to maintain the same thing
1:06:56 – 1:07:01

Once again, Giselle says what about who is working in a hospital? They're on a part-time full-time. Does that mean it's not counted?
1:07:01 – 1:07:11

I don't know what that means part-time full-time
1:07:11 – 1:07:13

30 hours per week is kind of the the minimum
1:07:13 – 1:07:18

Okay, Moe is from Merzouga
1:07:18 – 1:07:20

Okay, Beza as well at this stage there in terms of the expression of interest
1:07:20 – 1:07:28

There's going to be different points depending upon foreign work experience Canadian work experience
1:07:28 – 1:07:34

Excuse me, but
1:07:34 – 1:07:37

within each of the programs the Alberta opportunity stream
1:07:37 – 1:07:40

There are restrictions on the kinds of work permits for that program
1:07:40 – 1:07:43

but other programs like for example the accelerated tech pathway, which you if you have work experience in that category or rural renewal stream
1:07:43 – 1:07:51

Doesn't necessarily require that you have a work permit. So that's why I can't say, you know
1:07:51 – 1:07:56

No, it doesn't matter because the expression of interest doesn't require it
1:07:56 – 1:08:00

You always have to look at the underlying programs because the eligibility for those programs are the thing that's going to allow you to advance
1:08:00 – 1:08:06

To the next step. It's not just all about scoring the highest expression of interest points under your work experience
1:08:06 – 1:08:12

It's all about looking at the underlying programs. So it's not just about scoring a high expression of interest
1:08:12 – 1:08:17

It's about looking at the underlying programs that are going to allow you to advance to the next step
1:08:17 – 1:08:21

So it's not just about scoring a high expression of interest. It's about looking at the underlying programs that are going to allow you to advance to the next step
1:08:21 – 1:08:26

So it's not just about scoring a high expression of interest. It's about looking at the underlying programs that are going to allow you to advance to the next step
