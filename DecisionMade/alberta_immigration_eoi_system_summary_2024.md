The video explains the major changes to Alberta’s immigration program, specifically the Alberta Advantage Immigration Program (AAIP), which now uses an Expression of Interest (EOI) system and points grid to prioritize candidates.



**Key Points:**



​	1.	**Transition to EOI System**:

​	•	Alberta moved from a first-come, first-served system to an EOI model, similar to British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Ontario.

​	•	Candidates submit an EOI, and points are awarded based on specific criteria, rather than just meeting basic eligibility.

​	2.	**No Rush to Submit EOI**:

​	•	There is no immediate rush to submit an EOI, as Alberta will conduct draws periodically.

​	•	The first pool selection is expected around mid or late October 2024.

​	3.	**Points Grid**:

​	•	Points are based on work experience, education, and language skills.

​	•	Language: Minimum CLB 6 is required, and no extra points are given for scores higher than this.

​	•	Work Experience: Points are capped after 12 months of experience, meaning additional experience doesn’t add more points.

​	4.	**Challenges with the Previous System**:

​	•	The old system led to technical issues, such as website crashes due to high traffic during application windows.

​	•	People exploited the system with multiple devices and unreliable internet access created unfairness.

​	5.	**New Control for Alberta**:

​	•	Alberta can now better control who enters the pool, focusing on candidates who fit its labor market needs.

​	•	The province will prioritize streams like tourism and hospitality, which have fewer applicants, before streams like the Alberta Opportunity Stream (AOS), which is already over-subscribed.

​	6.	**Self-Declaration and Verification**:

​	•	Candidates self-declare their qualifications but must provide supporting documents later.

​	•	Any false information or misrepresentation will lead to disqualification.

​	7.	**Future Outlook**:

​	•	Alberta will periodically select candidates based on its labor needs and points ranking.

​	•	The new system reduces the randomness of the previous “race to file” method.



The changes aim to make the process fairer, more manageable, and better aligned with Alberta’s economic priorities.
