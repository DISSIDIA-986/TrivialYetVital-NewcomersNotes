# CalgarySurvivalGuide-UselessButHandy

- Welcome to my humble collection of *mostly* useless knowledge and life hacks, gathered from the first-hand experiences of a newcomer trying to navigate the wilds of Calgary. As a fresh-off-the-plane expat from China, I've come across plenty of tips, tricks, and tidbits that may seem trivial but might just save you from a minor inconvenience. Or they might not. Who knows?

- In this repository, you'll find random insights, silly solutions, and maybe even some helpful advice as I settle into this new life in Calgary. Whether you're a fellow newcomer or just here for a laugh, feel free to browse and add your own bits of wisdom!
